## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask db upgrade        # apply migrations
flask run               # defaults to http://localhost:5000
```

> **Note**: Environment variables such as `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `FLASK_ENV` can be set in a `.env` file.  See _.env.example_ for a template.

### 2. Admin User

On first run, the app auto-creates a default manager if none exists:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `changeme123`

You can override these via environment variables before first run:

* `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USER=yourname`
* `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASS=yourpass`

After login, visit `Users` (manager-only) to create additional users or reset passwords.

### 3. Batch Upload Walk-through

1. Navigate to **Inventory ‚Üí Batch Inventory** (Manager-only).
2. Download the template for the desired mode (Add-stock, Replace-stock, Update-prices, Full-update).
3. Fill or generate data (see `docs/samples/`).
4. Drag the CSV/XLSX onto the upload box and click **Preview**.
5. Review diffs, fix any validation errors, then click **Confirm Changes**.
6. Success toast appears; inventory is updated and the operation is logged.

Detailed step-by-step selectors and test cases live in `docs/automation_spec.md`.

## üî¨ Testing & Automation

| Area          | Tooling / Notes                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit / API    | pytest + Flask test client (planned)                   |
| UI Automation | Cypress / Playwright‚Äîstable selectors via `data-testid`|
| Sample Files  | `docs/samples/*.csv`                                   |

Run basic lint & unit tests (once tests are in place):

```bash
pytest
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

The app runs on any WSGI host. For Render:

1. Set environment variables (`SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_*`).
2. Ensure `gunicorn` is in `requirements.txt` and your start command uses it (e.g., `gunicorn app:app`).
3. Configure the service to deploy from the `main` branch. Trigger a deploy.
4. Optional: enable SQLAlchemy pre-ping in your config to avoid stale DB connections on Render.

Migrate automatically on startup or via CI step:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

## üìÇ Backup & Recovery

* Daily PostgreSQL dumps (`pg_dump`) recommended.
* Settings ‚Üí Download offers CSV snapshots of current inventory and sales.

## üåç Ghana-Specific Considerations

| Aspect      | Implementation                                    |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Currency    | Prices stored as floats; UI shows **GH‚Çµ** prefix with 2dp|
| Date Format | Forms use ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`; samples/exports may show `DD/MM/YYYY`|
| Mobile Money| Planned integration (MTN MoMo, Vodafone Cash)      |
